# Weather App

> I created a Weather App to explore the use of APIs in React.

Since, learning React, I figured it would be good to start putting some of the newly acquired knowledge into good use. This is my first React Project, which utilised key aspects of React such as:

- API integration
- Component Structure
- Build Command

# :running: Running the app

Clone this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JoshHaokip/react-weather-app.git

```

Install all dependancies:

```
$ npm install
```

Start the server:

```
$ npm start
```

And open the app in your browser at <http://localhost:3000/>.

# Project Overview

## Brief

> Build a weather app using an API to display actual weather forcasts

My idea is to build a weather app that connects to an API to show users the weather of areas they search for. I knew I wanted certain weather data to present such as wind speed, cloud forcasts and humidity.

## Learnings

> Here are some of the things I learnt during this project

Whilst completing this project, I was able to learn more about APIs. I now have a more rounded understanding of JSON objects and key concepts such as key/value pairs. As a result, I am now able to read and understand the structure of data from API's and extract them to the frontend.

I used the OpenWeather API for this project. I was able to discover a wide range of API's which will in no doubt help me when it comes to building a similar app in the future.
